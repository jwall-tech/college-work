			<h1 class="jumbotron"> What is computational thinking?</h1>
			<p class="well"> Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a computer, a human, or both, can understand.

			<h3 class="well"> The Farmer Problem </h3>
			
			<p class="well">The farmer needs to get across the river, but he can only take thing at a time with him in the boat.
However, he has a fox, a chicken and a bag of grain.
If he takes the grain first and leaves the fox with the chicken – the fox will eat the chicken. And the farmer doesn't want his chicken to be cockerel meat!
If he takes the fox first, then the chicken will eat the grain.
How does he get everyone across the river?
</p>
			
			<p class="alert alert-success"> The answer is pretty simple once you look at it, the only combination that can be left together is the fox and the grain. So you take the chicken over first, then you take the fox over and take the chicken back with you. Then you take the grain  over and then you take the chicken over. </p>
		
		
		<h3 class="well"> Four Cornerstones of Computational Thinking</h3>
		
		<p class="well">There are four key techniques (cornerstones) to computational thinking:
Decomposition - breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts
Pattern recognition – looking for similarities among and within problems
Abstraction – focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail
Algorithms - developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem
</p>
			
		<h3 class="well"> How it applies</h3>
		
		<p class="well">Computational thinking involves taking that complex problem and breaking it down into a series of small, more manageable problems (decomposition). Each of these smaller problems can then be looked at individually, considering how similar problems have been solved previously (pattern recognition) and focusing only on the important details, while ignoring irrelevant information (abstraction). Next, simple steps or rules to solve each of the smaller problems can be designed (algorithms).
Finally, these simple steps or rules are used to program a computer to help solve the complex problem in the best way.

</p>
			<h3 class="well"> Decomposition</h3>
			<p class="well">Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with.
