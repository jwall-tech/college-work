			<h1 class="jumbotron"> What is pattern recognition?</h1>
			<p class="well"> Pattern Recognition is where computers look at patterns and give an output dependant on that pattern, such as recognising if a picture is a cat or a dog, looking at questions and giving educated answers and more

			<h3 class="well"> Expert Systems </h3>
			
			<p class="well">An expert system is a computer that takes in user inputs and questions and give educated advice based on a knowledgebase. A knowledgebase is basically a database of experts knowledge that the computer uses to get its answers based on the questions.
</p>
			
			<p class="alert alert-success"> Knowledgebases often have hundreds of experts knowledge inside them  </p>
		
		
		<h3 class="well"> How they work </h3>
		
		<p class="well">The user inputs questions and data into a program, anything from "my light is not working" to "i work at x place", the program goes to the knowledgebase and sees if it can find any answers for the user based on the questions and data that has been inputted. This can be as extensive as finding cancer treatment to as simple as telling you what superhero you are thinking of.
